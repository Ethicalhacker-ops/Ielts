### **Step 3: Upload and Deploy on GitHub**

You are now ready to publish your website.

1.  **Go to GitHub.com** and create a new public repository.
2.  **Upload Files:** Click the "Add file" button and then "Upload files."
3.  **Select Files:** Drag and drop your `index.html`, `README.md`, and `.gitignore` files into the browser window.
4.  **Commit Changes:** Add a short message (e.g., "Initial commit") and click the "Commit changes" button.
5.  **Activate GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your new repository's **Settings** tab.
    *   Navigate to the **Pages** section on the left.
    *   Under "Build and deployment," choose the `main` branch as your source.
    *   Click **Save**.

GitHub will now build and deploy your website. After a minute or two, it will be live at the URL shown on the Pages settings screen. You will have a professional, working website with a live chat and a contact form that sends inquiries directly to your email.
